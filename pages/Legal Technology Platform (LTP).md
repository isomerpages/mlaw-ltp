**What is the LTP?**

The LTP is a matter management tool designed around legal workflows, and integrated with legal technology tools and public services commonly used by Singapore law firms. It was co-developed by MinLaw and its technology partner, Lupl, by building Singapore-specific features onto Lupl's base platform, which is available globally and has users from over 200 companies and 30 countries.

**How will the LTP help lawyers and law firms?**

The LTP will streamline lawyers' day-to day workflows by providing a one-stop platform that provides then with a bird's-eye view of key information related to their matters, so that they can concentrate on more substantive legal work.

Key LTP Features include:
* Management and tracking of legal workflows, such as assignment of tasks and reminders.
* Integrated view of communications, including viewing email correspondence from within the matter channel and chat messages from Slack (a 3rd party messaging app).
* Coordinate projects across different platforms, such as the ability to initiate sharing of documents through WhatsApp, and check on the status of matters via Microsoft Teams.
* Interoperability with existing legal technology tools popular among Singapore lawyers, such as Tessaract and Clio, and video-conferencing tools such as Zoom.
* Knowledge hub, which hosts templates and checklists for lawyers' use.

Upcoming (beyond 2Q 2022)
* Progressive enhancements to improve connectivity with systems that lawyers often interact with, such as eLitigation and LawNet.
* Enhancements of existing features based on feedback from Singapore lawyers.

**How secure is the LTP?**

MinLaw encourages all users of legal technology to read the Law Society of Singapore's Guide to Cybersecurity (INSERT LINK) in order to make informed decisions about the tools they adopt.

The LTP was built with input from a group of leading legal departments and law firms, and incorporates their security and privacy requirements. These were combined with best practices in secure system design, to ensure a privacy and security first approach.

* The LTP currently holds SOC 2 Type 1 and Cloud Security Alliance STAR Level 1 certifications.
* It complies with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations, including Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
* LTP data belonging to Singapore users will be hosted in Singapore, with data masking and strict access controls in place.
* These are complemented by third-party data and security audits and penetration testing done annually, as well as continuous code and network vulnerability testing throughout the year.
* The data protection and user agreement for the LTP is also accessible to the public here (INSERT LINK HERE) for prospective users to make an informed decision.

SOC 2 Type 2 audit and certification is planned for the year, and efforts to achieve ISO 27001 certification will follow shortly after.

**What technical support can lawyers get?**

There will be dedicated personnel from Lupl to onboard and train lawyers on the essential features of the LTP, and help lawyers get started. There is no need for lawyers to worry about maintenance as the LTP will be upgraded automatically with maintenance and security patches pushed down to the users on the back end. A 24/7 technical helpline will be available for Singapore users, to address any troubleshooting needs.
