## Supporting Singapore law firms in their digitalisation journey

The Ministry of Law ("MinLaw") and Enterprise Singapore ("Enterprise SG") have put together the **LTPI Funding Programme** to support Singapore law firms in their digitalisation by lowering the initial costs of adopting the LTP and its integrated solutions.

Eligible law firms may apply for the Productivity Solutions Grant for the Legal Sector at [GoBusiness Gov Assist](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/productivity-solutions-grant/all-psg-solutions/), for support of up to 70% of qualifying costs of adopting select pre-scoped IT solutions, and for up to two years (subject to a grant cap of S$ 30,000 per annum per entity)
