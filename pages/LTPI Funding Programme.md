MinLaw is working with Enterprise Singapore ("ESG") on a funding programme to defrat law firms' initial cost of adopting the LTP and legal solutions integrated or bundled to the LTP.

Eligible law firms may apply for the Productivity Solutions Grant for the Legal Sector at [GoBusiness Gov Assist](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/productivity-solutions-grant/itsolution/legal/), for support of up to 70% of qualifying costs of adopting select pre-scoped IT solutions, and for up to two years (subject to a grant cap of S$ 30,000 per annum per entity).

**1. What are the solution categories supported under this funding programme?**

The solutions categories that are supported for now include:
a) Matter Management and Collaboration Tool
b) Practice Management Systems
c) Document Management Systems

We will explore including more solution categories such as online legal research tools, document review/assembly tools and AML/KYC tools progressively.

**2. What qualifying criteria must a law firm meet in order to benefit from this funding programme?**

The applicant entity should be a Singapore Law Practice (SLP) that satisfies the threshold requirements set out in Rule 3 of the Legal Profession (Law Practice Entities) Rules 2015.

In addition, the firm should fulfil the following eligibility criteria:
* Firm's turnover of not more than S$100 million, or firm's total employment of not more than 200 employees.
* Subscription of IT solution must be used in Singapore.

In addition, prior to application submission, the company must not have:
* Made any payment to the solution provider or third party in relation to the subscription of the IT solution.
* Signed any contract with any solution provider or third party in relation to the subscription of the IT solution.

**3. Can SLPs that were funded under earlier funding programmes such as Tech Start for Law and Tech-celerate for Law apply for the funding programme?**

SLPs who have previously tapped on Tech Start for Law and/or Tech-celerate for Law can still qualify for the LTPI funding programme if they are adopting a solution from a different solution category. If the SLP wishes to switch solution within the same category, they should contact MinLaw. Please refer to the table below for more details.

**Illustration:**

| **Tech-Start for Law or Tech-celerate for Law** | **LTP funding** | **Eligibility** |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Category 1; Brand A   | Category 2; Brand X     | Yes   |
| Category 1; Brand A   | Category 1; Brand B | Contact MinLaw |


**4. How much funding can each SLP potentially receive? Is there a cap for the funding for each firm?**

The amount and duration of support vary according to the solution chosen. The grant cap is S$300,000 per annum per entity. The cap can be shared across all solutions adopted by the SLP within PSG.

| **Solution that is ...** | **Integrated and commercially bundled with LTP**(1) | **Integrated with LTP, but not commercially bundled with LTP**(1) | **Neither integrated nor commercially bundled with LTP**(1) | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| **Duration of support per SLP** | Up to two years | Up to one year | Not supported | 
| **Amount of support per SLP** | Up to 70% | Up to 70% | 0%  | 
| **Grant cap per SLP**  | S$30,000 per annum per entity across all solutions within PSG | S$30,000 per annum per entity across all solutions within PSG  | S$30,000 per annum per entity across all solutions within PSG  |

**5. Why is the duration of the support extended to two years for some solutions?**

The typical duration of support for adopting of technology solutions is usually one year under the standard PSG programme. For the legal sector, we have decided to extend the duration to two years for this LTPI funding programme, so that the law firms have a longer runway to realise the benefits of adopting the LTP and solutions that are integrated and commercially bundled to it. 

**6. Why are some solutions supported for one year, and some two years?**

We are prioritising solutions that are both integrated and commercially bundled with LTP for the two-year funding support. This is because we want to further encourage the adoption of these solutions as using them with the LTP is more seamless (due to the integration) and they offer greater value-for-money for SLPs that use the LTP (due to the commercial bundles with the LTP). 

**7. Can you elaborate on the application and claims processes for an SLP, e.g. documents to be submitted, time taken to approve and time taken to reimburse?**
