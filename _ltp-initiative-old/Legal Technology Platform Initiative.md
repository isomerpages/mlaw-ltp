The Ministry of Law ("MinLaw") launched the Technology and Innovation Roadmap ("TIR") in 2020, a 10-year plan that guides MinLaw's Legal Technology ("legaltech") efforts.

The Legal Technology Platform Initiative ("LTPI") is a key initiative under the TIR to enhance the technology adoption rate among small and medium Singapore law practices ("SLPs"), through addressing the lack of economies-of-scale in terms of cost and IT expertise and providing the Legal Technology Platform ("LTP") to streamline the lawyer's day-to-day workflows. The key thrusts of the LTPI are:
1. The **Legal Technology Platform** ("LTP"), an easy-to-use, one-stop matter management tool integrated with legaltech solutions and public service systems commonly used by law firms in Singapore.
2. **Industry Engagement and Validation** to validate the LTP's features; and
3. A **funding programme** to defray the initial cost of adopting the LTP and legaltech solutions integrated with it.
