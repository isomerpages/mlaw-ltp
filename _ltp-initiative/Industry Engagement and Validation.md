The LTP was developed for Singapore law firms in close consultation with more than 100 lawyers from small and medium Singapore law firms, including through feedback sessions co-organised by the Law Society of Singapore with its members and relevant standing committees.

**LTP Industry Engagement and Advisory Group ("IEAG")**

The IEAG was jointly appointed by MinLaw and Lupl, to ensure ongoing engagement and validation of the LTP's features. The IEAG is a group of early adopters from small and medium SLPs, to test, provide feedback and advocate the use of the LTP. Here's what the IEAG members have to say about the LTP.
