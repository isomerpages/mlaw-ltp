**1. What is the Legal Technology Platform Initiative all about?**

The Legal Technology Platform Initiative (or LTPI for short) is a world-first initiative spearheaded by MinLaw to lower the barriers to entry for small- and mid-sized Singapore law practices to adopt and successfully use technology.
The LTPI is part of the LegalTech Adoption Support outlined in MinLaw’s “Technology and Innovation Roadmap”.
MinLaw has partnered with Lupl, a legal matter collaboration platform, to provide the technology platform powering the LTPI.
Several other industry stakeholders across the public and private sectors are also involved in aspects of the initiative.

**2. Will it be compulsory for SMPs to participate in the LTPI?**

No. Participation in the LTPI, and use of the LTP, is not compulsory. While MinLaw expects that firms will see substantial value from participating and using the platform, the decision to participate in the LTPI is down to each individual SML firm.
