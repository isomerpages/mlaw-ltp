# Legal Industry Technology and Innovation Roadmap

**A sector-wide plan to promote innovation, technology adoption and development in Singapore's legal industry up to 2030.**

The need for transformation is now more pressing due to COVID-19 and disruption from AI, blockchain, multi-disciplinary practices and alternative legal services providers.

The Legal Industry Technology and Innovation Roadmap (TIR) was a year-long effort led by MinLaw in collaboration with 90 industry stakeholders in 2020.

It presents intiatives and recommendations to support law firms and in-house legal teams in their transformation journeys, e.g.:
*  Identify technologies that will impact legal services
*  Explores ways to support the development and adoption of such technologies
