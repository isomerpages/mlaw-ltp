**What is the LTP?**

The LTP is a matter management tool designed around legal workflows, and integrated with legal technology tools and public services commonly used by Singapore law firms. It was co-developed by MinLaw and its technology partner, Lupl, by building Singapore-specific features onto Lupl's base platform, which is available globally and has users from over 200 companies and 30 countries.

How will the LTP help lawyers and law firms?

The LTP will streamline lawyers' day-to day workflows by providing a one-stop platform that provides then with a bird's-eye view of key information related to their matters, so that they can concentrate on more substantive legal work.

Key LTP Features include
* Management and tracking of legal workflows, such as assignment of tasks and reminders.
* Integrated view of communications, including viewing email correspondence from within the matter channel and chat messages from Slack (a 3rd party messaging app).
* Coordinate projects across different platforms, such as the ability to initiate sharing of documents through WhatsApp, and check on the status of matters via Microsoft Teams.
* Interoperability with existing legal technology tools popular among Singapore lawyers, such as Tessaract and Clio, and video-conferencing tools such as Zoom.
* Knowledge hub, which hosts templates and checklists for lawyers' use.
