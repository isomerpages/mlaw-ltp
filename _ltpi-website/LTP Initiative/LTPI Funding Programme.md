MinLaw is working with Enterprise Singapore ("ESG") on a funding programme to defrat law firms' initial cost of adopting the LTP and legal solutions integrated or bundled to the LTP.

Eligible law firms may apply for the Productivity Solutions Grant for the Legal Sector at [GoBusiness Gov Assist](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/productivity-solutions-grant/itsolution/legal/), for support of up to 70% of qualifying costs of adopting select pre-scoped IT solutions, and for up to two years (subject to a grant cap of S$ 30,000 per annum per entity).
