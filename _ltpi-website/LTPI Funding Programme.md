MinLaw is working with Enterprise Singapore ("ESG") on a funding programme to defrat law firms' initial cost of adopting the LTP and legal solutions integrated or bundled to the LTP.

Eligible law firms may apply for the Productivity Solutions Grant for the Legal Sector at [GoBusiness Gov Assist](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/productivity-solutions-grant/itsolution/legal/), for support of up to 70% of qualifying costs of adopting select pre-scoped IT solutions, and for up to two years (subject to a grant cap of S$ 30,000 per annum per entity).

**1. What are the solution categories supported under this funding programme?**
The solutions categories that are supported for now include:
a) Matter Management and Collaboration Tool
b) Practice Management Systems
c) Document Management Systems

We will explore including more solution categories such as online legal research tools, document review/assembly tools and AML/KYC tools progressively.

2. What qualifying criteria must a law firm meet in order to benefit from this funding programme?
The applicant entity should be a Singapore Law Practice (SLP) that satisfies the threshold requirements set out in Rule 3 of the Legal Profession (Law Practice Entities) Rules 2015.

4. Can SLPs that were funded under earlier funding programmes such as Tech Start for Law and Tech-celerate for Law apply for the funding programme?
5. How much funding can each SLP potentially receive? Is there a cap for the funding for each firm?
6. Why is the duration of the support extended to two years for some solutions?
7. Why are some solutions supported for one year, and some two years?
8. Can you elaborate on the application and claims processes for an SLP, e.g. documents to be submitted, time taken to approve and time taken to reimburse?
9. Will this funding programme be available for foreign law practices, joint law ventures and formal law alliances?
